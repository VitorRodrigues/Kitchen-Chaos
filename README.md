# Kitchen-Chaos
Game created following Code Monkey's amazing tutorial for beginners on Unity engine

This amazing indie developer creates a bunch of game development content on [Youtube](https://www.youtube.com/@CodeMonkeyUnity) and the latest tutorial so far was a game similar to the amazing Overcooked.

I was eager to learn how to develop this kind of game from end-to-end then I followed his course all along, and I am impressed by the quality and all the knowledge he shares. Even paid courses does not share that much basic knowledge and good practices on software development.
